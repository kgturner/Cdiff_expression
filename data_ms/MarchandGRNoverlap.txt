TAIR Accession	Name	Description
AT1G10940	SNRK2.4	Encodes a plant protein kinase similar to the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase subfamily and the SNF1 kinase subfamily (SnRK2) whose activity is activated by ionic (salt) and non-ionic (mannitol) osmotic stress. Kinase activity of its homolog in tobacco is induced by hyperosmotic condition within 1 minute.
AT4G35090	CAT2	"Encodes a peroxisomal catalase, highly expressed in bolts and leaves. mRNA expression patterns show circadian regulation with mRNA levels being high in the subjective early morning. Loss of function mutations have increased H2O2 levels and increased H2O2 sensitivity. Mutants accumulate more toxic ions yet show decreased sensitivity to Li+. This decreased sensitivity is most likely due to an insensitivity to ethylene. Note that in Queval et al. (2007) Plant Journal, 52(4):640, SALK_057998 is named as cat2-1, SALK_076998 is named as cat2-2; in Bueso et al. (2007) Plant Journal, 52(6):1052, SALK_076998 is named as cat2-1. TAIR has adopted the nomenclature consistent with that in Bueso et al. (2007) after consultation with the authors: SALK_076998 (cat2-1), SALK_057998 (cat2-2)."

AT1G07890	APX1	"Encodes a cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase APX1. Ascorbate peroxidases are enzymes that scavenge hydrogen peroxide in plant cells. Eight types of APX have been described for Arabidopsis: three cytosolic (APX1, APX2, APX6), two chloroplastic types (stromal sAPX, thylakoid tAPX), and three microsomal (APX3, APX4, APX5) isoforms. At least part of the induction of heat shock proteins during light stress in Arabidopsis is mediated by H2O2 that is scavenged by APX1. Expression of the gene is downregulated in the presence of paraquat, an inducer of photoxidative stress."
AT5G62530	ALDH12A1	"Encodes mitochondrial Delta-pyrroline-5- carboxylate dehydrogenase. Involved in the catabolism of proline to glutamate. Involved in protection from proline toxicity. Induced at pathogen infection sites. P5CDH and SRO5 (an overlapping gene in the sense orientation) generate 24-nt and 21-nt siRNAs, which together are components of a regulatory loop controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and stress response."

AT1G15690	AVP1	"Encodes a H(+)-translocating (pyrophosphate-energized) inorganic pyrophosphatase (H(+)-PPase; EC 3.6.1.1) located in the vacuolar membrane. Expression is found in all tissues examined, including meristems and floral organ primordium. Expression is particularly enhanced in pollen, and is repressed by light. Over expression and loss of function phenotypes suggest AVP1 is involved in regulation of apoplastic pH and auxin transport. The effect on auxin transport likely involves effects of extracellular pH on subcellular localization of auxin efflux carriers such as PIN1."
AT4G09570	CPK4	Encodes a member of Calcium Dependent Protein Kinase (CDPK) gene family.Positive regulator of ABA signaling. Phosphorylates ABA responsive transcription factors ABF1 and ABF4.

Mutations disrupted ABA induction of stomatal closure as well as ABA inhibition of light-induced stomatal opening. However, regulation of stomatal opening/closing by light or CO(2) is not affected in these mutants. May act in the interval between ABA perception and reactive oxygen species production in the ABA signalling network."
AT4G01370	MPK4	Encodes a nuclear and cytoplasmically localized MAP kinase involved in mediating responses to pathogens. Its substrates include MKS1 and probably MAP65-1.The MAP65-1 interaction is involved in mediating cortical microtuble organization.

Possibly regulates auxin-dependent responses by influencing basipetal auxin transport in the root. Acts upstream of phyA in regulating hypocotyl elongation and gravitropic response. Exerts nonredundant, partially overlapping functions with the ABC transporter encoded by AtPGP1."
AT1G70940	PIN3	"A regulator of auxin efflux and involved in differential growth. PIN3 is expressed in gravity-sensing tissues, with PIN3 protein accumulating predominantly at the lateral cell surface. PIN3 localizes to the plasma membrane and to vesicles. In roots, PIN3 is expressed without pronounced polarity in tiers two and three of the columella cells, at the basal side of vascular cells, and to the lateral side of pericycle cells of the elongation zone. PIN3 overexpression inhibits root cell growth. Protein phosphorylation plays a role in PIN3 trafficking to the plasma membrane."
