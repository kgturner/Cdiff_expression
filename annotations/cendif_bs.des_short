Expression is induced in response to salicylic acid and methyl jasmonate and bacterial pathogens. sulphotransferase 12 (SOT12); CONTAINS InterPro DOMAIN/s: Sulfotransferase domain (InterPro:IPR000863); BEST Arabidopsis thaliana protein match is: P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases superfamily protein (TAIR:AT2G03770.1); Has 2910 Blast hits to 2872 proteins in 198 species: Archae - 0; Bacteria - 232; Metazoa - 1693; Fungi - 1; Plants - 543; Viruses - 0; Other Eukaryotes - 441 (source: NCBI BLink).
