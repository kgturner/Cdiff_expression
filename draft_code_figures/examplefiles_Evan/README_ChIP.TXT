This disc contains the design information you need to analyze
your NimbleGen arrays.  The .ndf file contains the actual probe
sequences and their location on the array.  The document, 
"ReadmeDesignFile.doc" describes the contents and layout
of this file.  Although this file is simple columns of text,
it is too large to open in Excel.  You should be able to open
and read this in Wordpad or Notepad.

The .pos file contains the position information for each probe
in the design.  You will need this file to generate the promoter
or ChIP reports from NimbleScan.

The .gff file contains annotation for the regions covered by 
this design.  You can use this to compare your results to the
map of the genes in this build of the genome in the SignalMap
application.
